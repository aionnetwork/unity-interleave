\section{Conclusions}

We provided an update to the original Unity protocol presented in \cite{wu2019unifying},
depicting the flaws in the protocol in \S\ref{double_spend_attack} and the motivation
that initially led to the creation of the Unity Interleave. We presented theoretical
and empirical evidence that the updated protocol produces a stable network, and is
resistant to a variety of attacks, benefiting from its hybrid nature.

There is more work to be done related to the protocol, our exploration of attack vectors
while useful is still somewhat preliminary. As indicated in the original Unity paper,
we will seek to analyze and examine the protocol from a abstract setting, a prospect
now made available to us with the launch of the OAN network.
